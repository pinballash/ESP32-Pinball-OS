<h1>Quick Start</h1>
<p>You may wish to try out running the code on an ESP32 before connecting it to a PCB or even soldering to a breadboard - in this case try these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your development environment.  I used Visual Studio Code with Playform IO</li>
<li>Get a copy of this code and set up a new project</li>
<li>If on a Windows device, replace forward slash symbols with backslash - this is because your operating system will deal with folders differently</li>
<li>Edit the file SETTINGS>globalVariables.h and change the variable webOn to true, then save</li>
<li>You should be able to build and upload the code staight away using a USB cable</li>
<li>Connect your device to the new Wifi called <b></b>ESP32Pinball-Configure-Me</b></li>
  
</ol>
